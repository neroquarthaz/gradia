# betproject

I am a BBA student specializing in Data Analytics. I wanted to do a project that covers all areas of data science to learn them in depth. Also, since I am a poor student, I wanted to do something, if possible, can provide me with additional income.

I like e-sport, and in my previous work, one part of my responsibilities was to work as an admin for a sports betting website. Recently, I have been working on a project to collect and predict stock price. I managed to collect 2 million rows of data with 500 columns accross 5000 companies, and I started using statistical methods, and started developing machine learning algorithms on top of the data. However, since the stock market is one of the most efficient markets in the world, it is pretty hard to achieve even the smallest wins.

Therefore, to not be discouraged, I wanted to find something that is not as efficient as stock market, something that is predictable. And I came to a conclusion to create a betting algorithm. This project will cover all areas of data science where I will learn practical skills to become a good data scientist.

**1. Data Collection:** First of all, I want to learn data collection in depth. I will be using APIs, but I am specifically interested in web scraping such as using beautiful soup library, or using pupetteer. So, I will be scraping e-sport match data live from betting websites, streaming websites, the official gaming platform etc.

**2. Data Storing & Database Management:** In here I will try to explore and build on my data engineering skills, specifically SQL. I will be practicing ETL, data pipelining, and overall, learn Database management skills i depth.

**3. Data Preparation & Analysis:** In here, I will use my current python skills to process the data. However, I'd like to explore more data visualizing techniques using softwares such as teableu and Power BI. Ultimately, this step will be for preparing the data for the machine learning algorithms.

**4. Machine Learning Model Development:** In here, I will create a simple model to generate predictions. At first, my goal is to explore all the areas of data science and get used to it. After everything, I will work on creating better models.

**5. Server:** I want to put everything live on server so it can fetch data in real life and analyze them. This is something completely new to me, so I am excited to explore. I want it to work live and send me email whenever new match gets added and new prediction is made.

**6. Github & Portfolio:** In my previous project, I haven't been officially documenting my project which I believe was a mistake. So, this time, I will be documenting everything on Github and make it a portfolio to show my future employer.

I am sure I will learn a lot throughout this project and my objectives may change several times.
